# DSA Practice Codes

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my DSA Practice repository. I've been using these code snippets and mini-projects to practice and learn about different data structures and algorithms. Feel free to explore and see how these concepts work in action!

## Whatâ€™s Inside

### Data Structures

- **Linked List**: Check out how I implemented a singly linked list, including basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.  

- **Stack**: Both array-based and linked-list-based implementations of the stack data structure.  

- **Queue**: A classic queue implementation with all the essential operations.  

- **Binary Tree**: Implementation of a binary tree with insertion and traversal methods.  

- **Graph**: Basic graph representation using adjacency lists, plus BFS and DFS algorithms.  

### Algorithms

- **Sorting**: Various sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.  

- **Searching**: Implementations of Linear Search and Binary Search.  

- **Pathfinding**: Visualization of the A* (A-star) algorithm for finding paths in a grid.  

- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to classic dynamic programming problems like the Fibonacci sequence and Knapsack problem.

And Many More
